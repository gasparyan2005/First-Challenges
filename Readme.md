### Sololearn and 150 challenges eBook
<hr>

The [Challenges.ipynb](https://github.com/gasparyan2005/First-Challenges/blob/master/Challenges.ipynb) file included in the Repository contains problems and equivalent answers written by me.

I started solving problems from the eBook included in this repository when I completed Sololearn's Python for Beginners course. The [certificate](https://github.com/gasparyan2005/First-Challenges/blob/master/certificate.jpeg) is included.
